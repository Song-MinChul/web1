<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/"target="blank" >JavaScript (English: JavaScript)
  is an object-based scripting programming language. It is primarily used within web browsers
  and has the ability to access built-in objects from other applications. It is also used for
  server-side network programming, such as runtime environments like Node.js. JavaScript was
  originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name
  Mocha and later under the name LiveScript and finally JavaScript. JavaScript is similar in
  syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, but in fact both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of
  the C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Except for its name and
  syntax, it has more similarities to self and schemes than Java.
As of January 2013, the most recent version is JavaScript 1.8.5 [3], which is supported by
Firefox 3. The JavaScript version that corresponds to standard ECMA-262 Third Edition is 1.5.
 ECMAScript is simply a standardized version of JavaScript. The Mozilla 1.8 beta 1 introduced
 support for E4X (ECMA-357), an extension to XML. JavaScript is supported differently in
 different browsers.
