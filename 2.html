  (CSS) are languages that describe how markup languages are actually displayed [1].
  They are primarily used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is a W3C standard
   and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.
If the markup language is responsible for the body of the website, then CSS can be a
 decorative part of clothes and accessories. In other words, changing the CSS file without
 changing the HTML structure can make it look like another website.
CSS3, which is currently under development, has added the ability to replace images created
 by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations. A variety
 of animation features have also been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.
